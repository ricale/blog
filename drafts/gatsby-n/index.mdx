> As mentioned above the html field was removed from the GraphQL node. We know that some of you used this for e.g. gatsby-plugin-feed. Unfortunately, for compatibility and performance reasons we had to remove it. We recommend using the excerpt field in the meantime until we find a feasible solution to provide MDX rendered as HTML. If you have any suggestions, please comment on the GitHub Discussion.
